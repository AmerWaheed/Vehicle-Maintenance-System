Designed and implemented a full console-based system for managing vehicle maintenance information using C++ arrays, structures, and file I/O. The project includes an admin login system, record creation, updates, deletion, and filtered searching by model, year, mileage, and part replacements. Data persistence is handled through text-file serialization, demonstrating clean data handling and structured programming.
